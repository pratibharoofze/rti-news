    "13. Maharashtra Government Gazette, Extraordinary Part One - Central Sub-Division, November 19, 2013 / Kartik 28, Shake 1935* (b) If the proposal has been approved at the level of the Secretary of another department, such proposal will be scrutinized at the level of the Joint Secretary or Deputy Secretary of the Finance Department or Planning Department or General Administration Department, and there will be no objection to rejecting it at the Joint Secretary or Deputy Secretary level: Provided that for such purpose, the Secretary of that department must issue such order; (c) If the Secretary of that department does not agree with the opinions given by the Joint Secretary or Deputy Secretary of the Finance Department or Planning Department or General Administration Department, such file will be sent back to the Finance Department or Planning Department or General Administration Department, as the case may be, for review at the Secretary level. (d) If a proposal has been sent forward by another department at the Secretary level according to clause (g) above, and the Finance Department or Planning Department or General Administration Department wishes to reject such proposal, such rejection will be done at the Secretary level of the Finance Department or Planning Department or General Administration Department, as the case may be. (e) After the opinion of another department has been recorded and the matter is received back by the original department, if differences of opinion are found, instead of writing more notes on this matter, the Secretaries of both departments or the officers to whom powers have been delegated will personally discuss the disputed question and dispose of the matter by mutual consent. (f) If the original department wants to mark a file to more than one department, the file will be submitted to those departments in the same order in which the original department marked it. (g) If adoption of the procedure prescribed in clause (f) above is likely to cause delay in disposing of the matter, and if the opinions expected from the departments are unlikely to be supportive or are inconsistent or contradictory with the opinions of the original department, the original department will prepare a separate proposal and forward the file to each concerned department separately, seeking their opinions or views. (h) If the department is of the opinion that a particular matter received in its branch or desk is related to another department, the department will specify clearly the exact entry of the Maharashtra Government's Rules of Business to which this subject is related and, after obtaining the consent of the Secretary of that concerned department, send this matter to the concerned department. (i) If a question arises whether action on correspondence received by a department should be taken by that department or by any other department, both departments will discuss and resolve such question. If this question is not resolved within one week, a decision on that question will be taken by the Organization and Methods Branch of the General Administration Department, and once a decision is made at the level of the Secretary of the Organization and Methods (O&M) Branch of the General Administration Department, it will be final unless there are any other directions from the Chief Secretary or Hon. Chief Minister. If such a question regarding handling of a subject arises in any office other than a Secretariat department, this matter will be referred by the department heads within two working days to the concerned Secretary of the Secretariat department. (j) Even if the question of transferring a subject from one department to another is under consideration, the department that received the correspondence will continue to handle the subject related to it until a decision is made on the question of transferring it to another department. In such matters, a separate proposal for transferring the subject will be made by that department. (k) While creating informal references to other departments for matters of investment and infrastructure projects, such matters will not be forwarded like other general matters. Doubts will be resolved through discussion at the Secretary level or at least Under Secretary level, and notes will be made after obtaining agreement through initial procedure, so that time is not wasted in repeatedly writing and submitting notes. A control register for matters received regarding investment and infrastructure projects will be maintained in the office of the Secretary of the Secretariat department as well as in other offices through the Secretary's personal assistant or, as the case may be, the department head, and on either the first or last day of the week, the Secretary of the department or department head will review the disposal or implementation of such matters based on this control register.",

(f) In matters where information has been sought from subordinate or field officers, the specific date by which the information is expected will be mentioned in the letter sent by the Secretariat department. The specified time limit for the subordinate or field office to submit the required information will be determined considering the scope of the information, the working days likely required to collect information from offices subordinate to that department or district-level office, and the time required to actually send that information. *13. Measures for making final decisions on matters within prescribed time limit. - The time limit prescribed under Section 10 of the Act for disposal of matters is maximum, and matters will be disposed within that time limit. The following measures will be taken to avoid delay regarding such matters: (a) The standards set for the work of government employees will be used to review whether the office work assigned to them is being disposed of properly or not. This periodic review will be done by each office head or department head or any other officer authorized in this regard by the end of each month. If such standards are not specified, they will be promptly specified by each office head or department head. (b) For making decisions on matters, wherever possible, powers will be delegated to each office or department head under the administrative control of Secretariat departments, and periodic review will be done of how effectively these delegated powers are being used, and necessary measures will be taken in this regard. (c) The procedure specified for taking action on matters for final decision will be reviewed and improved if necessary. *14. Determining matters mentioned in Section 11 of the Act and preparing a list. - The concerned administrative department at the Secretariat level and the department head at the divisional level or, as the case may be, the district office head at the district level will prepare a list of matters or subjects that fall under Section 11, to which the provisions of Section 10 of the Act will not apply in specific circumstances, and"
